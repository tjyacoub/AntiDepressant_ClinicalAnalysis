# ClinicalDataAnalysis

I recieved a pilot grant for data from all patients in the Northwestern University Hospital system who were prescribed anti-depressant medication.
I familiarized myself with features in clinical databases, and strategically chose features that I thought would be most informative and interesting, as I was limited in the amount of data I could recieve.  
In the end it came down to "Diagnosis" vs. "Doctor's Notes." I chose Doctor's Notes and have done some cool natural language processing with it. 

The hypothesis was that a patient should switch classes of anti-depressants after failing on one. For many reasons this turned out to be intractable.
